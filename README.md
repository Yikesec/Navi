# Project Navi ZSH Configuration

This README describes the custom Zsh shell configuration for a project titled "Navi". This configuration includes custom functions, aliases, and an ASCII art banner, offering a unique and personalized terminal experience. Follow the instructions below to implement this configuration in your own Zsh shell.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Zsh shell installed and set as your default shell. If you have not done this yet, you can use the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install zsh
    chsh -s $(which zsh)
    ```

- `oh-my-zsh` for managing your Zsh configuration. Install it with:

    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```

- `exa`, a modern replacement for `ls`. Install using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install exa
    ```

- `toilet` for ASCII art text. Install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install toilet
    ```

- `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugins. Install them with:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
    ```

- `curl` for making API requests. Install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install curl
    ```

### Installation Steps

1. **Backup your existing Zsh configuration** (if any):

    ```bash
    mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
    ```

2. **Copy the provided code** into your `~/.zshrc`:

    Create or open your Zsh configuration file with a text editor:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
   
    Copy and paste the provided Zsh code snippet into the file, and save it.

3. **Create a `lain_quotes.txt` File:**

    You should create a `lain_quotes.txt` in your home directory to store quotes for the `display_random_lain_quote` function to use:

    ```bash
    nano ~/lain_quotes.txt
    ```
   
    Add your favorite quotes line by line.

4. **Apply Changes:**

    To apply the new configuration, either restart your terminal or apply the changes with:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
